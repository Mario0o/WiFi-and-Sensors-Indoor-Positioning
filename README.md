# WiFi-and-Sensors-Indoor-Positioning (WaSpro)
This project introduces how to conduct indoor positioning using multi-sensors, including WiFi and mobile sensors, such as accelerometer and magnetometer.We use KNN algorithm to deal with WiFi RSS and use accelerometer and magnetometer to study stepping information of pedestrian.
